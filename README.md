I Sleep<br>
if you are wondering where all my github stuff is
its all in my other accounts or all secret ;) 
<br>
either something im not that proud of sharing or work related stuff
<br>
Im actually quite adaptable and can do self-learn the programming/software related skills to do most things. I have accrued various experiences over the years from random side projects
<br>
Some Personal Projects(that im allowed to share)(some are unfinished):
- Bookmarks Manager Website
- Anonymous Imageboard Forums
- REID System to Track Covid-19 Close Contacts
- MAL Ratings ML/AI 
- Harmony Game Mods
- Unfinished Games :^ )
